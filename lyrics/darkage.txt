breathing in the dark lying on its side
the ruins of the day painted with a scar
and the more i straighten out the less it wants to try
the feelings start to rot one wink at a time
oh oh forgiving who you are for what you stand to gain
just know that if you hide it doesnt go away
when you get out of bed dont end up stranded
horrified with each stone on the stage my little dark age
picking through the cards knowing whats nearby
the carvings on the face say they find it hard
and the engines failed again all limits of disguise
the humors not the same coming from denial
oh oh i grieve in stereo the stereo sounds strange
i know that if you hide it doesnt go away
if you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
open eyed burn the page my little dark age
i grieve in stereo the stereo sounds strange
you know that if it hides it doesnt go away
if i get out of bed youll see me standing all alone
horrified on the stage my little dark age
giddy with delight seeing whats to come
the image of the dead dead ends in my mind
policemen swear to god love seeping from their guns
i know my friends and i would probably turn and run
if you get out of bed come find us heading for the bridge
bring a stone all the rage my little dark age
i grieve in stereo the stereo sounds strange
i know that if you hide it doesnt go away
if you get out of bed and find me standing all alone
open eyed burn the page my little dark age
all alone open eyed burn the page my little dark age
