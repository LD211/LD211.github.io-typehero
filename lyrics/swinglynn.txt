hey there little honey wont you groove
ive been trying all night to dance with you
hey there little lonely wont you stay
i said i would rather die than feel this pain
you said i know i feel very much the same
but im afraid that i dont know knowing is not my thing
but i would like to dance with you
awkwardly in haze
to this little tune
i said hey there little honey wont you groove
ive been trying all night to dance with you
i said hey there little honey wont you stay
i said i would rather die than feel this pain
you said i know i feel very much the same
but im afraid that i dont know knowing is not my thing
but im sure i want to be with you
awkwardly in haze
to our little tune
well if you are sure
well i know im sure
well if you are sure
well i know im sure
well if you are sure
well i know im sure
well if you are sure
well i know im sure
well if you are sure
well i know im sure
well if you are sure
well i know im sure
well if you are sure
